# RESTless

## Description

RESTless is a web service built using Django Rest Framework that allows users to retrieve and manage quotes. With just a simple HTTP GET request to the API endpoint, users can obtain a random quote, providing an endless source of inspiration, motivation, or reflection.

In addition, users who have obtained an authentication token can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own quotes.

The quotes are sourced from a collection of inspiring and motivational quotes, making it a useful tool for developers who want to add a bit of inspiration to their applications.
